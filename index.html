                    <p>I hope this book feels like a warm hug to you. I wrote this book for the ones who feel everything too deeply. You're right, I wrote this book for you. This book was meant to find you if you've ever loved someone who didn't love you back, if you've ever over-invested in the wrong people or if you have a hard time letting go. I Don't Love You Anymore is a book that'll feel like home to you. I promise it'll hold you gently on your worst days.</p>

                    <p>After the death of his father, meek Jason finds an outlet for his anxiety at the Christian Puppet Ministry, in the devoutly religious, relatively quiet small town of Cypress, Texas. Jason's complicated relationships with the town pastor, the school bully, the girl next door, and -- most especially -- his mother are thrown into upheaval when Jason's puppet, Tyrone, takes on a shocking and dangerously irreverent personality all its own. </p>

                    <p> Stephanie had come halfway around the world, built a new life, met another man. And now Gerard Tenniel had arrived -- Gerard, who knew all about the scandal five years earlier and threatened to talk about it. Unless. It was the 'unless' that bothered Stephanie. She agreed that disclosure would hurt her brother's career, that her budding romance must die a-blooming. She even agreed to leave town with Gerard. So what else did he want?</p>
